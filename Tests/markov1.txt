Input Interaction Graph : 

(1,2)
(1,3)
(2,3)
(3,4)
(4,5)
(4,6)
(5,6)
For the corresponding graph, convergence was reached in 5 iterations : 

On close inspection it can be seen that 1,2,3 cluster together and 4,5,6 cluster together. This is exactly the clusters that 
should have been there in the corresponding graph, owing to Markov Rule.
